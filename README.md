# Simple Pages

## Content
This repository has simple pages that were the ones with which I started to learn HTML5 and CSS3, one of them has the BEM methodology, others are for the person's 
presentation, another one is to learn RWD patterns (Responsive Web Design) and another one to test what has been learned.
